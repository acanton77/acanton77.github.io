<p>2nd paragraph. <em>Italic</em>, <strong>bold</strong>, and <code>monospace</code>. Itemized lists
look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>this one</li>
<li>that one</li>
<li>the other one</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that — not considering the asterisk — the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.</p>

<p>Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., “it’s all
in chapters 12–14”). Three dots … will be converted to an ellipsis.
